# üõ†Ô∏è AI Code Debugger & Optimizer

## Project Overview

The **AI Code Debugger & Optimizer** is an innovative tool designed to analyze, debug, and enhance Python code using OpenAI's GPT-4o model. This application is tailored for developers seeking to improve code quality and performance quickly and efficiently. By leveraging AI, the tool automates the process of identifying code inefficiencies and errors, providing users with an optimized version of their code and a comprehensive analysis.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Code Analysis**: Automatically detects errors and inefficiencies in Python code.
- **Code Optimization**: Suggests optimal solutions and improvements for better performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use Streamlit-based interface that requires minimal input.
- **Secure API Management**: Secure handling of OpenAI API keys via the Streamlit sidebar.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides in-depth analysis reports and optimized code snippets.

## Installation & Setup Guide

To get the **AI Code Debugger & Optimizer** up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-code-debugger-optimizer.git
   cd ai-code-debugger-optimizer
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
   Ensure you have `requirements.txt` available in your project root.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Obtain an OpenAI API Key**:
   - Visit [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/) to get an API key.
   - Keep this key handy as it will be needed to run the application.

## Usage Instructions

Once installed and set up, you can start the application and use the **AI Code Debugger & Optimizer**:

1. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the application**:
   - Enter your OpenAI API Key in the sidebar to activate the tool.
   - Paste your Python code in the designated text area for analysis.
   - Click on "üîç Analyze & Optimize" to receive a comprehensive report along with optimized code suggestions.

## Technology Stack

This project leverages a robust technology stack to deliver its functionality:

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: Streamlit
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-4o

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your internet connection is stable as the application relies on external API requests to OpenAI.
- The application currently processes Python code only. Support for additional programming languages may be added in future updates.
- Future improvements include expanding optimization scope, integrating feedback mechanisms, and supporting batch code processing.
